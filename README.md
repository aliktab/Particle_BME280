# NeoRingDsp

A Particle library for BME280 chip

## Welcome to your library!

To get started, modify the sources in [src](src). Rename the example folder inside [examples](examples) to a more meaningful name and add additional examples in separate folders.

To compile your example you can use `particle compile examples/usage` command in [Particle CLI](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli#update-your-device-remotely) or use our [Desktop IDE](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/#compiling-code).

Libraries can also depend on other libraries. To add a dependency use [`particle library add`](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli#adding-a-library) or [library management](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/#managing-libraries) in Desktop IDE.

After the library is done you can upload it with `particle library upload` or `Upload` command in the IDE. This will create a private (only visible by you) library that you can use in other projects. If you wish to make your library public, use `particle library publish` or `Publish` command.

_TODO: update this README_

## Usage

Connect any BME280 hardware, add the BME280 library to your project and follow this simple example:

```
BME280 sensor(0x76, Wire);

void setup()
{
  sensor.begin();

  sensor.setup_sensor(
      BME280::mode_forced,
      BME280::sampling_x16,
      BME280::sampling_x16,
      BME280::sampling_x16,
      BME280::filter_off,
      BME280::standby_ms_0_5
    );

  Serial.begin();
}

void loop()
{
  sensor.make_forced_measurement();

  Serial.println(String::format("t: %f, p: %f, h: %f",
    sensor.get_temperature(), sensor.get_pressure(), sensor.get_humidity()));

  delay(1000);
}
```

See the [examples](examples) folder for more details.

## Contributing

Here's how you can make changes to this library and eventually contribute those changes back.

To get started, [clone the library from GitHub to your local machine](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

Change the name of the library in `library.properties` to something different. You can add your name at then end.

Modify the sources in <src> and <examples> with the new behavior.

To compile an example, use `particle compile examples/usage` command in [Particle CLI](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli#update-your-device-remotely) or use our [Desktop IDE](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/dev/#compiling-code).

After your changes are done you can upload them with `particle library upload` or `Upload` command in the IDE. This will create a private (only visible by you) library that you can use in other projects. Do `particle library add NeoRingDsp_myname` to add the library to a project on your machine or add the NeoRingDsp_myname library to a project on the Web IDE or Desktop IDE.

At this point, you can create a [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with your changes to the original library.

If you wish to make your library public, use `particle library publish` or `Publish` command.
